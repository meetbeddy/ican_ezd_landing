        note: "Technology drives the world, and the impact of technology on the Agricultural sector cannot be overemphasized. The world is at the cusp of the biggest economic transformation of any kind in this sector, as traditional farming is being replaced by brewing microbes to produce food. The arguments about plant-versus meat-based diets, are being made irrelevant by new technologies as most of our food will now be coming neither from animals nor plants, but from unicellular life. In view of the disconnect between population growth and food supply rate, this paper will be focusing on how these emerging technologies can be leveraged to achieve food security in Nigeria.",

It is therefore in the interest of nations to move beyond traditional GDP and start incorporating their natural capital into their national accounts to make better economic decisions.

Africa needed the agreement to integrate further into global supply chains. Africa's new free trade area is therefore a global game changer. Short-termism, polarization and isolationism as political tools have been the bane of African Continental trade over the years.
